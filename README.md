# Shape-Drawing-Applet

A Java-based interactive drawing application built using the `java.applet` and `java.awt` libraries. With a 400+ line of code written in This applet That allows users to draw various shapes (rectangles, ovals, lines) and freehand sketches, with options to customize colors, toggle solid fills, and erase or clear the canvas.

## Features
- **Shape Drawing**: Draw rectangles, ovals, and lines with customizable start and end points.
- **Freehand Drawing**: Create freehand sketches using the mouse.
- **Color Customization**: Choose from predefined colors (Red, Green, Blue) or use the default black.
- **Solid Fill**: Toggle between outlined and solid-filled shapes.
- **Eraser Tool**: Erase parts of the drawing with a customizable eraser.
- **Clear Canvas**: Reset the canvas to start fresh.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons for easy access to all tools and features.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language.
- **Java Applet**: For creating the interactive GUI.
- **Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**: For handling graphics, buttons, and mouse events.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Applet**: Compile and run the `shape_applet` class in a Java environment that supports applets.
2. **Select a Tool**: Use the buttons to choose between drawing shapes, freehand sketching, or erasing.
3. **Customize**: Change colors, toggle solid fills, or clear the canvas as needed.
4. **Draw**: Click and drag the mouse to draw shapes or freehand sketches.

## Code Structure
- **Main Class**: `shape_applet` handles the applet initialization, UI, and event listeners.
- **Shape Classes**: Abstract `Shapes` class with implementations for `rectangle`, `oval`, `line`, `Eraser`, and `Freehand`.
- **Event Handling**: Mouse and button events for interactive drawing.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more shape options (e.g., triangles, polygons).
- Implement a color picker for custom colors.
- Save and load drawings as image files.
